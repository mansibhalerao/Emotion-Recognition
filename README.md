# Emotion-Recognition
A model to recognize seven basic human expressions- happy, sad, anger, disgust, fear, surprise and neutral from any given image. <br>
I have implemented 3 different classifiers in this project: <br>
(1) a baseline classifier with one convolutional layer  <br>
(2) a CNN with a fixed size of three convolutional layers and <br>
(3) a deeper CNN with a parameterizable number of convolutional layers, filter dimensions, and number of filters. <br><br>
#### Constructed Convolutional Neural Network with Keras using TensorFlow backend.<br>

The both training and evaluation operations are handled with Fec2013 dataset.
